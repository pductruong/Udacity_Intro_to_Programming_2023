        <p class="interesting_fact">
          Tigers are not only strong swimmers, but they also have a unique
          affinity for water among big cats. Unlike many other feline species,
          tigers are quite comfortable in water and are known to enjoy bathing
          and swimming to cool off during hot days or to catch prey. They are
          skilled swimmers and can cross rivers and lakes easily in search of
          food or to expand their territory. This aquatic behavior sets tigers
          apart from most other big cats and contributes to their adaptability
          in various environments.

            <span class="fact_name">Species and Range</span>: Tigers (Panthera
            tigris) are the largest cats in the world and are native to various
            parts of Asia, including countries like India, Russia, China, and
            Indonesia. There are several subspecies of tigers, such as the
            Bengal tiger, Siberian tiger, Sumatran tiger, and more, each adapted
            to different habitats.

          <li>
            <span class="fact_name">Endangered Status</span>: Many tiger
            populations are endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and
            human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts are in place to
            protect these magnificent animals and their habitats. Tigers play a
            crucial role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="fact_name">Physical Characteristics</span>: Tigers are
            known for their striking orange coat with black stripes, which helps
            them blend into their environment for hunting and stalking prey. The
            pattern of stripes is unique to each individual, much like human
            fingerprints. Tigers have powerful limbs and can swim, which is
            unusual for big cats.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="fact_name">Hunting and Behavior</span>: Tigers are
            carnivores and primarily hunt large ungulates like deer and wild
            boar, but they can also eat smaller prey if necessary. They are
            solitary animals and are known for their stealth and patience when
            stalking prey. Tigers are generally territorial and mark their
            territories with scent markings.

          The tiger, scientifically known as Panthera tigris, is a majestic and
          powerful carnivorous mammal that belongs to the Felidae family. It is
          renowned for its awe-inspiring combination of strength, agility, and
          beauty. Tigers are the largest of all cat species and are recognized
          for their distinctive orange fur adorned with dark vertical stripes,
          which helps them blend into their forest habitats while stalking prey.
          Their muscular bodies, sharp senses, and retractable claws make them
          efficient hunters.
